# Waggle



Project 1 of Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI Udacity Nanodegree Program in Creating Visualizations with PowerBI course.
Waggle is a startup that makes smart devices for pets. Recently, Waggle has been thrilled by the success of their new Lapdog device, a fitness collar that lets owners track their dog’s steps, alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas! Reviews have been fantastic, sales are growing, and—best of all—the product really works!

The product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. Now, after months of data collection, you have been tasked with delivering a boardroom-ready Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog device to either help convince the CEO that Lapcat is the next big thing or a costly mistake to be avoided.
Below is a quick demonstration of the project components

The CEO is curious about the following questions:

Did the average daily steps increase for cats wearing the device as they did for dogs?
Were owners of Lapcat devices as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?

The Chief Marketing Officer would like your report to be “on-brand” by including only colors from the Waggle color palette, the Waggle logo, and other approved company logos and icons.
