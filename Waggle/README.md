# Waggle



Project 1 of Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI Udacity Nanodegree Program in Creating Visualizations with PowerBI course.
Waggle is a startup that makes smart devices for pets. Recently, Waggle has been thrilled by the success of their new Lapdog device, a fitness collar that lets owners track their dog’s steps, alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas! Reviews have been fantastic, sales are growing, and—best of all—the product really works!

The product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. Now, after months of data collection, you have been tasked with delivering a boardroom-ready Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog device to either help convince the CEO that Lapcat is the next big thing or a costly mistake to be avoided.
Below is a quick demonstration of the project components

Data Model

A snapshot of the Data Model is given below

The CEO is curious about the following questions:

Did the average daily steps increase for cats wearing the device as they did for dogs?
Were owners of Lapcat devices as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?

The Chief Marketing Officer would like your report to be “on-brand” by including only colors from the Waggle color palette, the Waggle logo, and other approved company logos and icons.

The product team expects to incorporate other visuals and insights as you see fit but is most interested in demographic comparisons between the dogs and cats using Waggle devices as well as any information about the families who own the pets. They would also like slicers to help them filter and explore on their own.

# The report must include :

At least five slicers on each page with at least one example of a drop-down slicer, at least one example of a slider slicer, at least one example of a hierarchy slicer, at least one example of a slicer with “Select All” enabled, and one example of a slicer with the search box enabled.

At least two bookmark features that allow users to dynamically swap one visual out with a different one and another must reset all applied filters on the page.

Buttons that help users navigate the report and respond when users hover over them by changing color or size (or both!).

# The report consists of 3 tabs :

The first page is focused on highlighting the differencein average daily steps and the average user rating between the Lapcat and Lapdog devices over time.

The second page is focused on visualizations related specifically to the pets dataset.

The third page is focused on visualizations related specifically to the families dataset.

Full report can be found on the Waggle repo

# Report Tab1 

To address CEO's questions:

The line chart depicts the difference of average daily steps between the Lapcat and Lapdog devices over time.

The bar chart shows the difference of user ratings between Lapdog and Lapcat devices which highlights the huge business difference and may have an impact on the CEO's decision.

# Report Tab2

To drive insights from the pets dataset, the second tab included:

A horizontal bar chart that demonstrates the Lapdog and Lapcat device usage by the gender of the pets.

The pie chart shows the top 3 dog breeds using the Lapdog product.

The table indicates the purchase breakdown of Lapcat and Lapdog products by online marketplaces.
