The mission is to tame the datasets and create an efficient data model for a small brewing company that will help them better understand what products are popular and profitable so they can mark smart decisions about what products to prioritize as the company continues to grow. The project demonstrates an understanding of core data modeling principles, including the ability to clean, organize and structure data in Power Query, make a date table, build a data model with the appropriate relationships and filters, and create a simple report using common visualizations and DAX measures.
